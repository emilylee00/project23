        William Shakespeare (bapt. 26 April 1564 – 23 April 1616) was an English poet, playwright and actor, widely
        regarded as the greatest writer in the English language and the world's greatest dramatist. He is often called
        England's national poet and the "Bard of Avon". His extant works, including collaborations, consist of
        approximately 39 plays, 154 sonnets, two long narrative poems, and a few other verses, some of uncertain
        authorship. His plays haveW been translated into every major living language and are performed more often than
        those of any other playwright

        <p style="font-size: 14px;">From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</p>
        <p>William Shakespeare (bapt. 26 April 1564 – 23 April 1616) was an English poet, playwright and actor, widely
        regarded as the greatest writer in the English language and the world's greatest dramatist. He is often called
        England's national poet and the "Bard of Avon". His extant works, including collaborations, consist of
        approximately 39 plays, 154 sonnets, two long narrative poems, and a few other verses, some of uncertain
        authorship. His plays haveW been translated into every major living language and are performed more often than
        those of any other playwright.</p>

        <p>Shakespeare was born and raised in Stratford-upon-Avon, Warwickshire. At the age of 18, he married Anne
        Hathaway, with whom he had three children: Susanna and twins Hamnet and Judith. Sometime between 1585 and 1592,
        he began a successful career in London as an actor, writer, and part-owner of a playing company called the Lord
        Chamberlain's Men, later known as the King's Men. At age 49 (around 1613), he appears to have retired to
        Stratford, where he died three years later. Few records of Shakespeare's private life survive; this has
        stimulated considerable speculation about such matters as his physical appearance, his sexuality, his religious
        beliefs, and whether the works attributed to him were written by others. Such theories are often criticised for
        failing to adequately note that few records survive of most commoners of the period.</p>

        <p>Shakespeare produced most of his known works between 1589 and 1613. His early plays were primarily comedies and
        histories and are regarded as some of the best work produced in these genres. Until about 1608, he wrote mainly
        tragedies, among them Hamlet, Othello, King Lear, and Macbeth, all considered to be among the finest works in
        the English language. In the last phase of his life, he wrote tragicomedies (also known as romances) and
        collaborated with other playwrights.</p>

        <p>Many of Shakespeare's plays were published in editions of varying quality and accuracy in his lifetime. However,
        in 1623, two fellow actors and friends of Shakespeare's, John Heminges and Henry Condell, published a more
        definitive text known as the First Folio, a posthumous collected edition of Shakespeare's dramatic works that
        included all but two of his plays. The volume was prefaced with a poem by Ben Jonson, in which Jonson
        presciently hails Shakespeare in a now-famous quote as "not of an age, but for all time".</p>

        <p>Throughout the 20th and 21st centuries, Shakespeare's works have been continually adapted and rediscovered by
        new movements in scholarship and performance. His plays remain popular and are studied, performed, and
        reinterpreted through various cultural and political contexts around the world. </p>

        <h2>Computer programming</h2>
        <hr style="border: 1px solid pink;">
        <p style="color: palevioletred;"><i>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</i></p>


        <p><span style="font-weight: bolder;">Computer programming </span>is the process of designing and building an
            executable computer program for accomplishing a specific computing task. Programming involves tasks such as:
            analysis, generating algorithms, profiling algorithms' accuracy and resource consumption, and the
            implementation
            of algorithms in a chosen programming language (commonly referred to as coding). The source code of a
            program is
            written in one or more languages. The purpose of programming is to find a sequence of instructions that will
            automate the performance of a task on a computer, often for solving a given problem. The process of
            programming
            thus often requires expertise in several different subjects, including knowledge of the application domain,
            specialized algorithms, and formal logic.</p>

        <h2 id="history" style="transition: ease 1s;">History</h2>
        <hr style="border: 1px solid pink;">

        <p>Programmable devices have existed at least as far back as 1206 AD, when the automata of Al-Jazari were
            programmable, via pegs and cams, to play various rhythms and drum patterns; and the 1801 Jacquard loom could
            produce entirely different weaves by changing the "program" - a series of pasteboard cards with holes
            punched in
            them.</p>

        <p>However, the first computer program is generally dated to 1843, when mathematician Ada Lovelace published an
            algorithm to calculate a sequence of Bernoulli numbers, intended to be carried out by Charles Babbage's
            Analytical Engine. Women would continue to dominate the field of computer programming until the mid 1960s.
        </p>

        <p>In the 1880s Herman Hollerith invented the concept of storing data in machine-readable form. Later a control
            panel (plugboard) added to his 1906 Type I Tabulator allowed it to be programmed for different jobs, and by
            the
            late 1940s, unit record equipment such as the IBM 602 and IBM 604, were programmed by control panels in a
            similar way; as were the first electronic computers. However, with the concept of the stored-program
            computers
            introduced in 1949, both programs and data were stored and manipulated in the same way in computer memory.
        </p>

        <p>Machine code was the language of early programs, written in the instruction set of the particular machine,
            often
            in binary notation. Assembly languages were soon developed that let the programmer specify instruction in a
            text
            format, (e.g., ADD X, TOTAL), with abbreviations for each operation code and meaningful names for specifying
            addresses. However, because an assembly language is little more than a different notation for a machine
            language, any two machines with different instruction sets also have different assembly languages. Kathleen
            Booth created one of the first Assembly languages in 1950 for various computers at Birkbeck College.</p>

        <h3>Quality requirements</h3>

        <ul>
            <p style="margin-left: -30px;">Whatever the approach to development may be, the final program must satisfy
                some fundamental properties. The
                following properties are among the most important:</p>
            <li>Reliability: how often the results of a program are correct. This depends on conceptual correctness of
                algorithms, and minimization of programming mistakes, such as mistakes in resource management (e.g.,
                buffer overflows and race conditions) and logic errors (such as division by zero or off-by-one errors).
            </li>
            <li>Robustness: how well a program anticipates problems due to errors (not bugs). This includes situations
                such as
                incorrect, inappropriate or corrupt data, unavailability of needed resources such as memory, operating
                system
                services and network connections, user error, and unexpected power outages.</li>
            <li>Usability: the ergonomics of a program: the ease with which a person can use the program for its
                intended purpose or
                in some cases even unanticipated purposes. Such issues can make or break its success even regardless of
                other
                issues. This involves a wide range of textual, graphical and sometimes hardware elements that improve
                the clarity,
                intuitiveness, cohesiveness and completeness of a program's user interface.</li>
            <li>Portability: the range of computer hardware and operating system platforms on which the source code of a
                program can
                be compiled/interpreted and run. This depends on differences in the programming facilities provided by
                the different
                platforms, including hardware and operating system resources, expected behavior of the hardware and
                operating
                system, and availability of platform specific compilers (and sometimes libraries) for the language of
                the source
                code.</li>
            <li>Maintainability: the ease with which a program can be modified by its present or future developers in
                order to make
                improvements or customizations, fix bugs and security holes, or adapt it to new environments. Good
                practices[24]
                during initial development make the difference in this regard. This quality may not be directly apparent
                to the end
                user but it can significantly affect the fate of a program over the long term.</li>
            <li> Efficiency/performance: Measure of system resources a program consumes (processor time, memory space,
                slow devices
                such as disks, network bandwidth and to some extent even user interaction): the less, the better. This
                also includes
                careful management of resources, for example cleaning up temporary files and eliminating memory leaks.
            </li>

        </ul>






        Readability of source code
        In computer programming, readability refers to the ease with which a human reader can comprehend the purpose,
        control flow, and operation of source code. It affects the aspects of quality above, including portability,
        usability and most importantly maintainability.

        Readability is important because programmers spend the majority of their time reading, trying to understand and
        modifying existing source code, rather than writing new source code. Unreadable code often leads to bugs,
        inefficiencies, and duplicated code. A study[25] found that a few simple readability transformations made code
        shorter and drastically reduced the time to understand it.

        Algorithmic complexity
        The academic field and the engineering practice of computer programming are both largely concerned with
        discovering
        and implementing the most efficient algorithms for a given class of problem. For this purpose, algorithms are
        classified into orders using so-called Big O notation, which expresses resource use, such as execution time or
        memory consumption, in terms of the size of an input. Expert programmers are familiar with a variety of
        well-established algorithms and their respective complexities and use this knowledge to choose algorithms that
        are
        best suited to the circumstances.

        Chess algorithms as an example
        "Programming a Computer for Playing Chess" was a 1950 paper that evaluated a "minimax" algorithm that is part of
        the
        history of algorithmic complexity; a course on IBM's Deep Blue (chess computer) is part of the computer science
        curriculum at Stanford University.[27]

        Programming languages
        Different programming languages support different styles of programming (called programming paradigms). The
        choice
        of language used is subject to many considerations, such as company policy, suitability to task, availability of
        third-party packages, or individual preference. Ideally, the programming language best suited for the task at
        hand
        will be selected. Trade-offs from this ideal involve finding enough programmers who know the language to build a
        team, the availability of compilers for that language, and the efficiency with which programs written in a given
        language execute. Languages form an approximate spectrum from "low-level" to "high-level"; "low-level" languages
        are
        typically more machine-oriented and faster to execute, whereas "high-level" languages are more abstract and
        easier
        to use but execute less quickly. It is usually easier to code in "high-level" languages than in "low-level"
        ones.

        Programmers
        Computer programmers are those who write computer software. Their jobs usually involve:

        Coding
        Debugging
        Documentation
        Integration
        Maintenance
        Requirements analysis
        Software architecture
        Software testing
        Specification

    <h1> Mathematical formulas</h1>
    

    <p>A linear equation is any equation that can be written in the form</p>

    <p class="ax">  ax + b = 0</p>
    <p>where <b> <i>a</b></i> and <b><i>b</i></b> are real numbers and <b><i>x</i></b> is a variable. This form is sometimes called the standard form of a linear

    equation. Note that most linear equations will not start off in this form. Also, the variable may or may not be an <b><i>x</i></b>
    so don’t get too locked into always seeing an <b><i>x</i></b> there.</p>

    <h4>Quadratic Equation</h4>

    <p>The standard form of a quadratic equation looks like this:</p>

    <p class="ax">ax<sup>2</sup>+ bx + c = 0</p>

    <p>where <b><i>a</i></b>, <b><i>b</i></b>, <b><i>c</i></b> are known values and <b><i>x</i></b> is the variable or unknown (we don't know it yet). Also, <b><i>a</i></b> can't be 0.</p>

    <h4>The area of a circle (A)</h4>

    <p><b>&pi;</b> (Pi) times the radius (<b><i>r</i></b>) squared:</p>

    <p class="ax">A =  &pi; &times; r<sup>2</sup></p>

    <p>or, when you know the diameter (<b><i>D</i></b>):</p>
    <p class="ax">A =(&pi;/ 4 &times; D<sup>2</sup>)</p>





    <p>or, when you know the circumference (<b><i>C</i></b>):</p> 


    <p class="ax">A = C<sup>2</sup> / 4 &times; &pi;</p>

    <h4>Intersection</h4>

    
    <p>The intersection of two sets <b><i>A</i></b> and <b><i>B</i></b>, denoted by A &cap; B, is the set of all objects that are members of both the sets A and B. In symbols,</p>
    
   <p class="ax"> A &cap; B = { x : x &isin; A and x &isin; B } </p> 
    
    <p>That is, <b><i>x</i></b> is an element of the intersection A &cap; B if and only if <b><i>x</i></b> is both an element of <b><i>A</i></b> and an element of <b><i>B</i></b>.</p>
